Version: 0.4.7
Date: ????
  Changes:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.6
Date: 2025-06-05
  Bugfixes:
    - Forces created in init handlers are caught in the configuration changed handler now.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.5
Date: 2025-03-20
  Features:
    - Added support for the sound PrintSettings.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.4
Date: 2024-12-29
  Scripting:
    - Added `"surface"` as a possible send level
  Bugfixes:
    - The lua commands now don't squash any output (but they now appear after the output..)
    - The evolution command now actually lists the evolutions for every surface
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.3
Date: 2024-12-05
  Features:
    - Added an api for modifying sent messages. The intent being the ability to filter.
    - Actually expose ability to clear chatlog for a player.
  Commands:
    - Replicated /command & /c
      Will not replicate any output (like printed error) as that'd require running it a second time.
      Running the given code a second time will cause *tons* of unintended consequences.
    - Logged /silent-command & /sc
    - Replicated (kinda) /measured-command & /mc
      The measured time does not get saved as that's just unfeasible without running the code a second time.
      It also doesn't clear the engine's normal response as that'd clear the measured time.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed inconsistencies between clearing prints and regular prints. This was achieved by consolidating the functions more.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.2
Date: 2024-11-08
  Bugfixes:
    - Commands should no longer crash when entered from a server console
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.1
Date: 2024-11-07
  Changes:
    - Updated shortcodes for 2.0
  Features:
    - Added a global setting to change how normal messages are sent.
    - Added /t and /team commands to send messages normally.
    - Added option to show timestamps next to each message. These are in-game time, as real time is simply not something mods can get.
    - Added imagify support for planets and space-locations (wrapped under the same setting)
  Commands:
    - Replicated /help & /h
    - Replicated /clear
    - Replicated /admins
    - Replicated /players
      - Doesn't behave exactly the same, but similar enough.
  Bugfixes:
    - Stops trying to imagify qualitied tags
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.0
Date: 2024-10-21
  Changes:
    - Made compatible with 2.0
  Features:
    - You can now specify a shortcode variation (eg `:wood~1:`) for instances of conflicting shortcodes.
      A variation of 0 is the same as no variation.
    - Now, in singleplayer, replaces shortcodes within a levenshtein distance of 2 to account for typos. This does not work if you specify a variety other than 0 (the default)
      This is limited to singleplayer because it still hitches badly. I will gladly welcome people who know more than me optimizing it!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.3
Date: 2024-08-23
  Features:
    - A large portion of the Factorio Discord's emotes now have shortcodes available by default. Specifically the ones that are just in-game items.
    - You can now disable the 'closed' chat. This is intended to combat the latency issues with it without entirely removing it.
  Changes:
    - Now uses real migrations instead of jank on_configuration_changed migrations.
    - Default fade value is now 0.8 to at least show it exists.
  Commands:
    - Replicated /seed
    - Replicated /evolution
    - Replicated /time
    - Replicated /reply & /r
    - Replicated /color
  Bugfixes:
    - /w and /s now actually work
    - Whispering now can't crash if there's no recipient passed
    - Intentional ephemeral messages now actually replace system messages
    - Back to Back replaceables now work properly
    - Technology messages should be sent to all friendly forces, not every force except the one who unlocked it
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.2
Date: 2024-07-26
  Bugfixes:
    - Research events are now sent to friendly forces
    - Disabling commands now actually works (theoretically)
    - The player tag is actually used when sending chats
    - Spectators don't send the event that is used to open chat, so they are now statically open
  Scripting:
    - Added a parameter to send_message to skip clearing the chat.
      This also makes the message actually make a sound when printed since it's not piggy-backing on the entire chat print which is silent by necessity
    - Can now handle colors that are arrays rather than objects
    - send_message can now take a table of parameters instead. Old method of parameters remains for compatibility
  Issues:
    - The direct-printing of not clearing the chat uses a hacked-together method of printing the message. Leading to times where it might print incorrectly because it doesn't do the pre-processing that is done for internal use.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.1
Date: 2024-03-12
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed CHARACTER always being the killer. Still might happen with edge cases
    - 0.3.0 migration now works. Will go back and fix old versions with broken migrations if requested
  Info:

  Scripting:
    - Added an interface to disable event(/command) handlers so you can implement your own
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.0
Date: 2024-03-10
  Major Features:
    - Other mods can now use the interface to print messages that won't get deleted
  Bugfixes:
    - General messages now actually use their color
    - Added admin checking on promote/demote so it doesn't falsely report something has happened
  Info:
    - Refactored Chats to now just use a localized string instead of a 'header' and 'message'
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.8
Date: 2024-03-09
  Major Features:
    - Chat now naturally prints a select portion, only for opening chat to print everything
  Changes:
    - Improved research queue messages
    - Now uses command listener for admin promotion so it can respond accurately
  Bugfixes:
    - Migration is working again
  Issues:
    - Adding to research queue is not an event, so it doesn't work
    - Removing from research queue does not report the user, so it gets a descriptive "Unknown"
    - A message being sent while you're in chat, will make chat small again.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
