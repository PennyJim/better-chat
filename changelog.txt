Version: 0.3.4
Date: ????
  Changes:
    - Made compatible with 2.0
  Features:
    - You can now specify a shortcode variation (eg `:wood~1:`) for instances of conflicting shortcodes.
      A variation of 0 is the same as no variation.
    - Now, in singleplayer, replaces shortcodes within a levenshtein distance of 2 to account for typos. This does not work if you specify a variety other than 0 (the default)
      This is limited to singleplayer because it still hitches badly. I will gladly welcome people who know more than me optimizing it!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.3
Date: 2024-08-23
  Features:
    - A large portion of the Factorio Discord's emotes now have shortcodes available by default. Specifically the ones that are just in-game items.
    - You can now disable the 'closed' chat. This is intended to combat the latency issues with it without entirely removing it.
  Changes:
    - Now uses real migrations instead of jank on_configuration_changed migrations.
    - Default fade value is now 0.8 to at least show it exists.
  Commands:
    - Replicated /seed
    - Replicated /evolution
    - Replicated /time
    - Replicated /reply & /r
    - Replicated /color
  Bugfixes:
    - /w and /s now actually work
    - Whispering now can't crash if there's no recipient passed
    - Intentional ephemeral messages now actually replace system messages
    - Back to Back replaceables now work properly
    - Technology messages should be sent to all friendly forces, not every force except the one who unlocked it
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.2
Date: 2024-07-26
  Bugfixes:
    - Research events are now sent to friendly forces
    - Disabling commands now actually works (theoretically)
    - The player tag is actually used when sending chats
    - Spectators don't send the event that is used to open chat, so they are now statically open
  Scripting:
    - Added a parameter to send_message to skip clearing the chat.
      This also makes the message actually make a sound when printed since it's not piggy-backing on the entire chat print which is silent by necessity
    - Can now handle colors that are arrays rather than objects
    - send_message can now take a table of parameters instead. Old method of parameters remains for compatibility
  Issues:
    - The direct-printing of not clearing the chat uses a hacked-together method of printing the message. Leading to times where it might print incorrectly because it doesn't do the pre-processing that is done for internal use.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2024-03-10
  Major Features:

  Bugfixes:
    - General messages now actually use their color

  Info:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.8
Date: 2024-03-09
  Major Features:
    - Chat now naturally prints a select portion, only for opening chat to print everything
  Changes:
    - Improved research queue messages
    - Now uses command listener for admin promotion so it can respond accurately
  Bugfixes:
    - Migration is working again
  Issues:
    - Adding to research queue is not an event, so it doesn't work
    - Removing from research queue does not report the user, so it gets a descriptive "Unknown"
    - A message being sent while you're in chat, will make chat small again.
