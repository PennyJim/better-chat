# Better Chatting
### An attempt at improving Factorio's built in chat.

Recommended to be combined with [Twemoji](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/twemoji-in-factorio) or [Fluent Emoji](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/fluent-emoji) (or both)

## Emojipack
The main reason I made this mod, is to add support for discord style emotes. eg: `:purple_heart:` -> ðŸ’œ

This functions by other mods calling `remote.call("emojipack registration", "add")` with the mod name and a dictionary of shortcodes and their tags. I recommend using `[img=<type>.<item>]` rather than `[<type>=<item>]` as it looks significantly nicer in chat.

## Scripting
To print a permanent message instead of letting Better Chat clear it away, use `remote.call("better-chat", "send")`
The arguments are:
1. The `LocalisedString` that is the message
2. The `Color` of the message
3. Whether the message is intended for `"global"` broadcast, a `"force"` level message, or a `"player"` specific message.
4. The id of the recipient force or player. (ignored for global broadcast)

## Todo List:
- [x] Use *Proper* migrations
- [x] Add toggleable chat timestamps?
  - They will be in hh:mm:ss format
  - Start using game.ticks_played instead of game.tick?
- [ ] Add moderation filters
- [ ] Add nicknames
